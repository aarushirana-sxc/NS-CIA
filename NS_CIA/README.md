First run the server.py file. This is your main python socket interface file, which helps you binds the socket to a port. This will help you establish the connection from your client side to the database through the common wifi channel.
Then run the client.py on your client device which is a mobile phone for this case. This file is a tkinter based UI.(Important: Before running the client, you must edit client.py and replace SERVER_IP with your computer's local IP address.)
I'm running the client.py file using Pydroid 3 application on my phone.
There's a database.py file which handles all the SQLite database operations (Creating tables, inserting orders). The file is based on SQLite database which is a default library based sql database that python provides.
After the connection has been established I can simply use the application on my phone and the data gets saved in the database through the network channel created.
There are statements on the server side showing the commands in action.
